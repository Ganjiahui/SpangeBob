# SpangeBob
Using c++ OpenGL Graphics library to build a SpangeBob as my project during University
You need to open a new file in Visual Studio 2019, then implement these files and code into the file created. Then you can run the code, 
after the code had run, click the left mouse click twice and the SpangeBob will be shown.
